                <h1>Hi, I'm Sanchit</h1>
                <p>
                    A passionate and driven engineering student at NIT Patna. I thrive on challenges, whether it's
                    coding my way through a complex problem or exploring new adventures in life.
                    Qualified through JEE Advanced, I've built a strong foundation in programming, with proficiency in C
                    and Java, and I'm now focused on software development as my future career path.
                    I believe in blending logic with creativity, which reflects in both my academic journey and personal
                    interests like music, travel, and adventure.
                    A proud ex-KVian, I'm used to adapting and excelling in dynamic environments.
                    Currently preparing for placements, I'm sharpening my skills in problem-solving and application
                    development to create impactful software solutions.
